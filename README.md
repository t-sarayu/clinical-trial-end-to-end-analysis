- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL Server
- Power BI
- Excel

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Raw clinical trial data ingestion from Excel
2. Data cleaning & preprocessing using Python
3. Feature engineering (Age, BMI, Risk Flags, AE counts)
4. Data quality checks and reporting
5. Loading cleaned data into SQL Server
6. Power BI dashboard creation with advanced features
